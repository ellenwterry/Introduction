Analytics was first defined by Aristotle in "Prior Analytics" to describe a system of logic - a process for inference. While this course leverages a range of technologies, the goal is to build the capabilities to recognize, define, and integrate business drivers into models for planning and assurance. Pursuit of business drivers has a long history: From the first business intelligence channels described in the "Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes" in 1865, to Sam Walton flying over parking lots to count cars in 1950, to NLP and GPS applications searching social media and satellite images for clues to emerging trends *(read  JPMorgan's "Global Quantitative & Derivatives Strategy" provided)*.  

Integration of driver data into models has challenges and the data are often ambiguous. But we work to disambiguate and validate because the resulting models are more relevant, and explanatory *(provided the models are probabilistic)*. Then, we can add the more accessible, structured data often found in ERP and line-of-business systems. This is a core strength of Bayesian modeling, which includes:

* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Relevant business planning and assurance data often include: industry trends, opportunities and threats, competitor capabilities and capacity, brand loyalty and price sensitivity, intuition of experienced managers, etc. These data can integrated with operational data in a formal, statistically valid process that produces explanatory models with increasing credibility. 

* **Interpretable, Probabilistic Results** Bayesian analysis produces projections and parameters with probabilities that people can understand. It can answer the questions central to business analysis, like: *"how much of which resources do we need to achieve plan, and what's the probability of that happening?"* Machine learning *(ML)* and Artificial Intelligence *(AI)* can't do this. This directly addresses the risk management components of planning and assurance. 

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel. Multilevel analysis is not uniquely Bayesian, but Bayesian model does provide more flexibility and control. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific parameters. This also relates to multilevel design.

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can quickly integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to new data *(especially in major events where people tend to overreact)*. This architecture also provides for transfer of parameters between models *(circumventing model retraining problem in ML)*. This enables adaptation in dynamic transaction environments and an uncertain world.

Hopefully, these benefits motivate you to invest some time in learning Bayesian Analysis. The repositories here are:

* **Foundations**. Review of basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are prerequisite assumptions.

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian modeling with simple applications..

* **Advanced Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.
