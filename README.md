Forecasting, Analysis, Planning, and Assurance should be based on consistent models and metrics throughout: Forecasting provides a basis for planning *(which produces a budget approved by the board)*, which becomes a basis for assurance and testing. 

Enterprises operate in an ecosphere that is complex, dynamic and often ambiguous. Analyses should, at a minimum, comprehend: markets, customers, competitors, suppliers, and other relevant drivers *(economic drivers are factors that have a significant* **effect** *on the activity of an enterprise - i.e., they* **cause** *changes in enterprise activity and performance)*. Identification and integration of latent business drivers is a pursuit with a long history: from Aristotle *("Prior Analytics")*, to the first business intelligence channels described in the "Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes" in 1865, to Sam Walton flying over parking lots to count cars in 1950, to NLP and GPS applications searching social media and satellite images for clues to emerging trends *(note: read  JP Morgan's "Global Quantitative & Derivatives Strategy" provided)*, to modeling of customer sentiments from social media. Understanding how drivers affect business performance is key to forecasting, realizing competitive advantage and performance potential, and also performing efficient assurance and audit work *(the more independent, external drivers are integrated into assurance models, the less substantive validation is required and more independence the opinion)*. So, We're concerned with what *causes* something to happen, and how to **integrate ambiguous, latent drivers into models that can be used to understand business performance**. This requires reason, experience, intuition and judgment. Technology does not provide substitutes for these human capabilities - and overreliance on technology tends to result in poor analyses. Understanding first *(which is why we focus on case studies)*. 

And as we build understading of business drivers and models, our goal is to build competency in Bayesian methodologies, where driver integration is explicitly structured, and data / parameters are disambiguated and validated through model evolution. The benefits of Bayesian analysis to planning and assurance include:  

* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Business planning often begins with industry trends, opportunities and threats, competitor capabilities and capacity, brand loyalty and price sensitivity, intuition of experienced managers, etc. This data can be integrated with operational data into probabilistic models. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** The models produce projections and parameters with probabilities that people can understand and use - i.e., they're explanatory.  

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel *(either hierarchical or crossed effects)*. These effects are quantitative drivers that can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(e.g., business process)* for each parameter *(e.g., product)*. While multilevel analysis is not uniquely Bayesian, it does provide unique flexibility and control. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics. This architecture also provides for transfer of parameters between models *(circumventing retraining)*. This **agility** aligns well with high volume, dynamic transaction environments.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are **assumed to be prerequisite** and will only be reviewed in brief *(you can complete course assignments in either R or Python, or both - this is not a programming course)*  

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Analysis with focus on conditional probability, and distributions and regression modeling basics *(intro level statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Advanced Modeling (Multilevel, Pooling, Effects, Extended Equations) with Stan.   

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.
