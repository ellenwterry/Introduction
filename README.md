Analytics was first defined by Aristotle in "Prior Analytics" to describe a system of reasoning and inference. While this course leverages a range of technologies, the application of analytics is still a system of reasoning and inference, and technology just scales the processes - including those that are poorly reasoned. In this course, we focus on analytics as applied to planning and assurance processes. 
Planning processes translate business opportunities and threats to independent drivers of revenues, margins, risks, etc. Assurance is most relevant when it tests the execution of processes defined by the planning models, and most reliable when it can draw inferences from independent drivers. This course will explicitly introduce methods and models, while integrating business translation through case study. Balance is important here: Poorly designed "analytics" implementations are, unfortunately, quite common - often due to inflated expectations of technology, or weak, disintegrated business models *(the terms 'data driven' and 'dashboards' are red flags here)*.  We want to avoid encouraging these errors. 
Identification and  integration of relevant business drivers is not trivial pursuit. It's a pursuit with a long history: from the first business intelligence channels described in the "Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes" in 1865, to Sam Walton flying over parking lots to count cars in 1950, to NLP and GPS applications searching social media and satellite images for clues to emerging trends *(read  JPMorgan's "Global Quantitative & Derivatives Strategy" provided)*.  And once identified, the integration of driver data into models can be challenging. The data are often ambiguous and semi-structured, and must be redefined as model metrics. In Bayesian analysis, this translation is explicitly managed as data are disambiguated and validated. So, models evolve while  relevance and reliability are increased. Models are also explanatory *(i.e., actionable)*.  
Overall, Bayesian analysis provides many unique benefits in planning and assurance:
* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Business planning often begins with industry trends, opportunities and threats, competitor capabilities and capacity, brand loyalty and price sensitivity, intuition of experienced managers, etc. This data can be integrated with operational data into probabilistic models. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** The models produce projections and parameters with probabilities that people can understand and use - i.e., they're explanatory.  

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel *(either hierarchical or crossed effects)*. These effects are quantitative drivers that can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(e.g., business process)* for each parameter *(e.g., product)*. While multilevel analysis is not uniquely Bayesian, it does provide unique flexibility and control. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics. This architecture also provides for transfer of parameters between models *(circumventing retraining)*. This **agility** aligns well with high volume, dynamic transaction environments.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are assumed prerequisite and will only be reviewed in brief.

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Theory with focus on distributions and probability *(Intro statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Model Building process and templates for range of scenarios including regression and classification, single and multilevel, extended equations and nonlinear relationships, model validation and parameter / effects analysis.  

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.
