Analytics was first defined by Aristotle in "Prior Analytics" to describe a process for reasoning and inference. While the information technology industry has created an amazing array of tools, analytics is still about reasoning and inference, and tools are not a substitute for this very human capability.  That said, this is not a course in theory - some theory is necessary, but not an academic excursion. Rather, this course is about translating components of the economic ecosystem to models - and models are structures for reasoning and inference.  

Planning processes seek to understand and translate business opportunities and threats to independent drivers of revenues, margins, risks, etc. to models that support an actionable plan. Assurance processes extend planning models and test execution. If these models are based on independent drivers, then the process is more likely to be relevant.  

This course will explicitly introduce methods and models, while integrating business translation through case study. Balance is important here: Poor analyses are quite common, and often technology-driven, or data-driven rather than business-driven. Why? Because identifying business drivers is more difficult than installing software, looking at dashboards and stating the obvious.  

Identification and  integration of relevant business drivers is a pursuit with a long history: from the first business intelligence channels described in the "Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes" in 1865, to Sam Walton flying over parking lots to count cars in 1950, to NLP and GPS applications searching social media and satellite images for clues to emerging trends *(note: read  JPMorgan's "Global Quantitative & Derivatives Strategy" provided)*.  It's as much art as science and relies on creative intuition and curiosity - a fascination of how things work in the economy, what *causes* something to happen. And once identified, the integration of driver data into models can be just as challenging. The data are often ambiguous and semi-structured, but somehow must be structured as model metrics. 
Which brings us to Bayesian analysis, where this difficult driver translation is explicitly structured, and data are disambiguated and validated during model evolution. The benefits of Bayesian analysis to planning and assurance include:  

* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Business planning often begins with industry trends, opportunities and threats, competitor capabilities and capacity, brand loyalty and price sensitivity, intuition of experienced managers, etc. This data can be integrated with operational data into probabilistic models. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** The models produce projections and parameters with probabilities that people can understand and use - i.e., they're explanatory.  

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel *(either hierarchical or crossed effects)*. These effects are quantitative drivers that can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(e.g., business process)* for each parameter *(e.g., product)*. While multilevel analysis is not uniquely Bayesian, it does provide unique flexibility and control. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics. This architecture also provides for transfer of parameters between models *(circumventing retraining)*. This **agility** aligns well with high volume, dynamic transaction environments.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are **assumed to be prerequisite** and will only be reviewed in brief *(you can complete course assigments in either R or Python, or both - this is not a programming course)*  

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Analysis with focus on conditional probability, and distributions and regression modeling basics *(intro level statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Advanced Modeling (Multilevel, Pooling, Effects, Extended Equations) with Stan.   

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.

About Professor Ellen Terry

Ellen Terry began her career in M&A analysis at Deloitte, developing econometric models for industry forecasting and valuation, later transitioning to Post Merger Integration *(PMI)*. She worked with Microsoft on a PMI project segment (enterprise application integration), fell in love with the company, and joined Microsoft to lead development of industry solutions *(cross platform templates)*, and  implementation, leveraging partner channels. Post-Microsoft, she worked for GE as Director of Planning and Programs, and JP Morgan as VP Data Science. She's currently a Professor of Practice at Bauer, and an independent consultant/mentor to planning and assurance groups.
