These repositories support the **Bayesian Analysis for Forecasting, Planning and Assurance** course at the **Bauer Graduate Business School** and **HP Enterprise Data Science Institute**.

Enterprises operate in an economy that is complex and dynamic. The scope of analyses can include processes throughout the value-chain, including customers, competitors, suppliers, products, and many other drivers *(drivers are variables that have a significant* **effect** *on the outcome of an enterprise - i.e., they* **cause** *change in enterprise activity and performance)*. 


Data environments range from structured and consistent databases, to unstructured and ambiguous data lakes to expert opinion.  Regardless of data quality, analysts must build models for understanding and decision-making that comprehends all the relevant variables and evaluates their relevance and reliablity.

Bayesian analysis is a philosophy and methodology for modeling these complex, dynamic, ambiguous scenarios. Benefits of Bayesian analysis include:  

* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Often a model requires information that doesn't yet exist *(e.g., new products/markets)*. Additionally, expert opinion will bring more relevance and depth of understanding to a model that data have not comprehended. Experience and evidence can be integrated into probabilistic models that quntify reliablity and evolve with operation. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** Bayesian models produce *effect* parameters with probabilities that can be used to assess causality and reliability, and build projections and evaluate scenarios or interventions.

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel. These effects can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(from units to  processes)* for each parameter *(e.g., product)*. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are **assumed to be prerequisite** and will only be reviewed in brief *(you can complete course assignments in either R or Python, or both - this is not a programming course)*  

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Analysis with focus on conditional probability, and distributions and regression modeling basics *(intro level statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Advanced Modeling (Multilevel, Pooling, Effects, Extended Equations) with Stan.   

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.

About Professor Ellen Terry

Ellen Terry began her career in M&A analysis at Deloitte, developing econometric models for industry forecasting and valuation, later transitioning to Post Merger Integration *(PMI)*. She worked with Microsoft on a PMI project segment (enterprise application integration), fell in love with the company, and joined Microsoft to lead development of industry solutions *(cross platform templates)*, and  implementation, leveraging partner channels. Post-Microsoft, she worked for GE as Director of Planning and Programs, and JP Morgan as VP Data Science. She's currently a Professor of Practice at Bauer, and an independent consultant/mentor to planning and assurance groups.
