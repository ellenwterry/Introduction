Analytics was first defined by Aristotle in "Prior Analytics" to describe a system of logic - a process for inference. While this course leverages a range of technologies, analytics is still the same: an inference process - applied to business planning and assurance. Planning and assurance processes begin with identification and integration of relevant business drivers. This requires creativity: the pursuit of business drivers has a long history: From the first business intelligence channels described in the "Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes" in 1865, to Sam Walton flying over parking lots to count cars in 1950, to NLP and GPS applications searching social media and satellite images for clues to emerging trends *(read  JPMorgan's "Global Quantitative & Derivatives Strategy" provided)*. We develop this capability through case study, integrated with the study of statistics and modeling technologies.  

Integration of driver data into models also has many challenges, including data ambiguity, alluded to above. Business strategy, as reflected in the planning and assurance processes, is usually based on a set of assumptions and goals, that are semi-structured into rubrics, and then translated to metrics. In Bayesian analysis, this translation is explicitly managed as data are disambiguated and validated. So, models evolve and relevance is sustained. Models are also explanatory *(i.e., actionable)*, and quantitative.   

Bayesian Analysis has many unique benefits:      

* **Integration of Experience and Evidence** Business planning often begins with industry trends, opportunities and threats, competitor capabilities and capacity, brand loyalty and price sensitivity, intuition of experienced managers, etc. This data can be integrated with operational data into probabilistic models. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** The models produce projections and parameters with probabilities that people can understand and use - i.e., they're explanatory.  

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel *(either hierarchical or crossed effects)*. These effects are quantitative drivers that can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(e.g., business process)* for each parameter *(e.g., product)*. While multilevel analysis is not uniquely Bayesian, it does provide unique flexibility and control. 

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics. This architecture also provides for transfer of parameters between models *(circumventing retraining)*. This **agility** aligns well with high volume, dynamic transaction environments.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are assumed prerequisite and will only be reviewed in brief.

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Theory with focus on distributions and probability *(Intro statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Model Building process and templates for range of scenarios including regression and classification, single and multilevel, extended equations and nonlinear relationships, model validation and parameter / effects analysis.  

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.

About Professor Ellen Terry

Ellen Terry began her career in M&A analysis at Deloitte, developing econometric models for industry forecasting and asset valuation, later transitioning into Post Merger Integration *(PMI)*, transitioning valuation models and processes into operations. She joined Microsoft and led development of industry solutions *(solution templates)*, working through partner channels. Post-Microsoft, she worked for GE as Director of Planning and Programs *(plan implementation)*, and JP Morgan as a VP Data Science. She's a Professor of Practice at Bauer, and independently consults with Planning and Assurance clients and mentors consulting groups.
