### Bayesian Probability and Analysis

These repositories support the **Bayesian Probability and Analysis** course at the **Bauer Graduate Business School** and **HP Enterprise Data Science Institute**.

Enterprises operate in an economy that is complex and dynamic. The scope of analyses can include processes throughout the value-chain, considering customer, competitor, supplier, product, and many other drivers *(**drivers** are variables that have a significant* **effect** *on the outcome of an enterprise and* **cause** *change in enterprise activity and performance)*. 


Data environments range from structured and consistent databases, to unstructured and ambiguous data lakes, to expert opinion.  Regardless of data quality, analysts must build models for understanding and decision-making that comprehend all the relevant variables and evaluate their relevance and reliablity.

Bayesian analysis is both a philosophy and a methodology for modeling these complex, dynamic, ambiguous scenarios. The tools of a Bayesian Analyst include:  

* **Integration of Opinions, Experience and Evidence** Often a model requires information that doesn't yet exist *(e.g., new products/markets)*. Additionally, expert opinion brings a dimension to models that data often doesn't comprehend. Expert Opinions, Experience and Evidence can be integrated into probabilistic models that quantify the reliablity, and evolve as data are observed and collected. 

* **Explanatory Parameters** Bayesian models produce *effect* parameters with probabilities that can be used to assess causality and reliability, and build projections and evaluate scenarios or interventions. A major weakness with maching learning and AI applications.

* **Multilevel Analysis with Effects** Business value-chains and transaction environments are almost always multilevel and effects will cascade in ways that can't be modeled in single levels, no matter how many dimensions *(it truly creates a mess that is not explanatory or useful)*. These effects can be used to understand, project and plan at each level *(organizations, processes, objects)* for each parameter.  

* **Granular Control over Model Design and Tuning** Models can also be tuned *(and generalized)* down to specific levels and parameters. 

* **Bayesian Updating**. Bayesian models have a unique structure that can **quickly** integrate new data *(often in near real-time)*. This makes a huge difference in adjusting models to business dynamics.

Site Repositories *(recommend cloning as the content is frequently updated)*:

* **Foundations**. Basic statistics and linear algebra concepts necessary for Bayesian analysis *(in R and Python)*. These are **assumed to be prerequisite** and will only be reviewed in brief *(you can complete course assignments in either R or Python, or both - this is not a programming course)*  

* **Introduction**. Introduction to Bayesian Analysis with focus on conditional probability, and distributions and regression modeling basics *(intro level statistics is also an assumed prerequisite)*.   

* **Modeling**. Advanced Modeling (Multilevel, Pooling, Effects, Extended Equations) with Stan.   

* **Applications**. Case studies will include **planning**  *(e.g., planning orders, pricing policy, supply chain agreements, and industry trends)*, **operations and process automation** *(e.g., pricing products, assets and derivatives)* **assurance** *(e.g., project deliverables quality testing, controls testing and financial statement assertions)*.

About Professor Terry

Ellen Terry began her career in M&A analysis at **Deloitte**, focusing on forecasting and valuation modeling. She later joined **Microsoft**, leading development of economic/industry models and solutions *(i.e., cross platform templates)* - she was also involved research work at the **Santa Fe Institute**. Post-Microsoft, she worked for **GE** as Director of Planning and Programs, and **JP Morgan** as VP - Data Science. She's currently a Professor of Practice at Bauer, and an independent consultant and jazz musician [ellynsong](https://www.ellynsong.com).
